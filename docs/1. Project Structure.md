## 1.1 Repository Overview
---
This repository implements a full-stack sarcasm detection system:

- Backend with FastAPI service to train/evaluate pipeline for two models (Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes) and for local experimentations you can use the CLI.
- Frontend uses Vue 3 + Vite that were used to create a dashboard that consumes the API to train models, analyze the dataset, and run predictions.

  - `3-project-structure.md` (this document): Explains how the project is organized.


### 1.2.5 Build/Output Directories

- Backend:
  - `backend/results/`: Generated confusion matrix images saved during training.

  - `front/dist/`: Production build output created by `npm run build` (not checked in by default).


## 1.3 Key Files Explanation
---
- Backend runtime and API
  - `backend/app.py`: Is the web server core which provides a FastAPI application it loads `dataset.json` on startup (if present), it sets up CORS for local develompent, and offers the endpoints:
    - `GET /`: Service status and endpoint index
    - `POST /train`: Trains both models and returns comparison/summary
    - `POST /predict`: Predicts sarcasm for a given headline using trained models
    - `GET /analyze`: Returns dataset statistics and basic text analytics
    - `GET /status`: Minimal health/status information
  - `backend/main.py`: Users can use this for local experimentations it's a command-line flow that loads data, trains models, executes sample predictions, and prints a summary.
  - `backend/dataset.json`: Is the initial dataset used to train the AI models.

- AI core (`backend/ai_core/`)
  - `config.py`: Model and path configuration (test split, vectorizer settings, LR params, constants).
  - `data/models.py`: Data classes for training data, model results, and prediction results.
  - `models/base_model_trainer.py`: Base class for trainers with consistent, stratified splitting.
  - `models/bayes_naive_trainer.py`: Multinomial Naive Bayes trainer with bag-of-words features.
  - `models/logistic_regression_trainer.py`: Logistic Regression trainer with TFâ€‘IDF features.
  - `training/pipeline.py`: Orchestrates preprocessing, training, evaluation, and reporting; powers both CLI and API workflows.
  - `training/evaluator.py`: Computes metrics, prints classification reports, saves confusion matrices; includes a simple prediction service.
  - `utils/preprocess.py`: Contains helper methods for preprocessing text (like URL removal, punctuation filtering, stopword removal, tokenization).

- Frontend (`front/`)
  - `src/App.vue`: Is just a single webpage literally, it contains the axios code for handling API, typescript interfaces (that represent schemas in python) and etc. all the code of the front end is in this file.
  - `vite.config.ts`, `package.json`: Build configuration and scripts (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run preview`).
