## Notes
---
- CORS: Configured for `http://localhost:5173` for local frontend development.
- Dataset: The API attempts to load `backend/dataset.json` on startup. If missing, analysis and training endpoints will return 400 responses.
- Confusion Matrices: Saved during training to `backend/results/` and not returned by the API.
